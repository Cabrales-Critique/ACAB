# ACAB
I'm 26, learning general coding to start a career in IT.
I have a B.S. in Criminal Justice from CSUEB--Go Pioneers!
I'm a student full time at Ohlone College, studying to earn an A.A. in Natural Science with an Emphasis in Math and Technology and to be CRLA certified this Spring. 
Looking forward to learning more programming and making mistakes but shaking the dust off after. I stared with C++, then tweaked around with Python, and now I'm using HTML and CSS to create a website for a small business idea I have for English tutoring.
I love In-N-Out. 115! I love cooking. I make a mean breakfast and burger. 
Any questions, advice, and criticisms are all welcome: cabralescritique@gmail.com
