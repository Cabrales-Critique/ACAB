# ACAB
I'm 25, learning C++ mostly, and started looking into Python recently. 
I have a B.S. in Criminal Justice from CSUEB--Go Pioneers!
I'm a student full time at Ohlone College, studying to earn an A.S. in Computer Science.
Looking forward to learning more programming and making mistakes but shaking the dust off after.
I love In-N-Out. 115! I love cooking. I love that feeling after debugging a bug in your code too.
Any questions, advice, and criticisms are all welcome: alexcabrales@rocketmail.com
